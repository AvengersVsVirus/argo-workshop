# Hands-On ArgoCD Workshop

## Cluster Prerquisites

Install the following Operator to your cluter to get started:

* CodeReady Workspaces (for participant environments)
* OpenShift GitOps / ArgoCD (to have participants provision their own ArgoCD Instances)

Create a group for all participants and allow them to create ArgoCD Instances (You can find a Kustomize file at [cluster-preoeration/rolebindings](./cluster-preperation/rolebindings)).
